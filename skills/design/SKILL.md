# Design — decide what the user sees and does, before deciding how it's built

UX/UI counterpart to `/architecture`. Architecture decides *how* (file paths, schemas, types, endpoints); design decides *what the user sees and does* (shape, hierarchy, density, interaction grammar, motion, copy, states). Forces a multi-variant pass so the chosen design isn't the first thing that came to mind.

**Skip when:**
- The work package has no UI surface, OR
- An approved design already exists and this is a pure layout tweak (go straight to `/design-critique`), OR
- **No design system is configured** (`pipeline.config` `designSystem: null`). On backend / infra / library projects this skill does not apply.

Inspired by the "design shotgun" (three variants on a comparison board) and *Design It Twice* (from "A Philosophy of Software Design") — parallel sub-agents under different constraints, then broad → variants → spec → embodied artifacts.

## Project rules

Follow any `pipeline.config rules` slot below as binding (it overrides this skill on conflict); skip undeclared slots.

- **`{{rules.design-system}}`** — component budget, tokens, reuse-before-build, promotion rules these variants must honor.
- **`{{rules.frontend}}`** — client / UI conventions.
- **`{{rules.aesthetics}}`** — the project's aesthetic quality bar.
- **`{{rules.visual}}`** — visual fidelity / regression policy.

## When this runs

- **In the pipeline:** pipeline-planner persona, after `/refine` and before `/architecture`.
- **On explicit `/design <work-package-id>`:** any work package with a UI surface — especially **new load-bearing primitives** where multiple plausible shapes exist.
- **Skip** per the condition above. If an approved design exists and the change is a pure layout tweak, run only the in-session Phase 2 critique on the existing `approved.md`.

**Fixed input from `/refine`:** the founder-approved `.pipeline/work/<id>/requirements.md` (confirm `approvals.requirements` is set in `.pipeline/work/<id>/progress.json`). Variants explore the *visual / interaction shape* of a primitive — they do not redefine what that primitive IS. If a variant only works by changing the requirement, that's a `/refine` issue — return to Pass 1, not a design issue.

## Inputs

Read all of the following in one parallel batch of Read calls — these files are independent (anchor-scoped where possible):

1. The `## Work package` + `## Acceptance criteria` sections of `.pipeline/work/<id>/plan.md`.
2. `requirements.md` and the specific docs under `{{paths.docs}}` it cites in its **Required reading**. The requirement tells you which existing layout / component-budget files matter — do not browse `{{paths.docs}}` directly.
3. The design system's principles, aesthetics, and conventions docs under `{{designSystem.path}}`, plus the tokens at `{{designSystem.tokens}}`.
4. Any project aesthetic-quality / visual-parity rules the design system docs point to.
5. If a `design/` directory already exists for this work package under `.pipeline/work/<id>/`, you may be resuming.

For deeper reference material on specific critique dimensions (read on demand when scoring in Phase 2 — each cross-links the design system's own aesthetics documentation):

- `references/hierarchy.md` — visual-hierarchy tactics; primary / secondary / tertiary text levels.
- `references/spacing.md` — the spacing grid, density tiers, sub-grid exceptions.
- `references/typography.md` — type scale, weight limits, monospace usage.
- `references/color.md` — semantic token usage, halation guard, contrast rules.
- `references/finishing.md` — hover / focus / pressed states, motion tokens, polish details.

Without these, the Phase 2 critique becomes vibes-grading. Read the relevant reference before assigning a score on its dimension.

## Phase 0a — Classify: routine vs novel

Before interrogation, classify the work package along two axes:

1. **Existing component reference** — does the spec name an existing component family (e.g. "extend `<RowComponent>`", "another tab in `<DrawerComponent>`")?
2. **Pattern match** — does `{{designSystem.path}}` contain a similar embodied pattern (same primitive, same shape)?

Both yes → `routine`. Both no → `novel`. Mixed → `routine` with low-confidence flag (see below).

| Class | Variants in Phase 1 | Phase 2 critique |
|---|---|---|
| `novel` | 3, full constraint-and-thesis spread | per-variant + on `approved.md` |
| `routine` | 1, with a "did we consider X / Y / Z?" check on the rejected directions | only on `approved.md` |
| `routine` (low-confidence) | 2, A vs. B | per-variant + on `approved.md` |

**Low-confidence trigger.** If only one of the two axes matched (e.g. spec references an existing component but the design system has nothing analogous, or vice versa), or the in-session critique on the single variant flags Anti-slop / Hierarchy / States below 5, fall back to 2 variants. Better to spend one extra variant than to ship unexplored UI.

**Hard rule for new design-system primitives.** Any new load-bearing primitive — a named shape that other components compose from — is **always `novel`** regardless of axis match. The shape itself is what's being decided.

Output one machine-greppable line at the top of `brief.md`:

```
DESIGN-CLASS: <routine|routine-low-conf|novel>  ref=<existing-component-or-none>  pattern=<design-system-file-or-none>
```

## Phase 0 — Interrogate the task

Pick only the questions that are actually unsettled — skip what the brief, the design system rules, or existing mockups already answer. For each remaining question, propose your read with evidence, then ask the human (or pipeline-reviewer in autonomous mode) to confirm. Issue all probes in one parallel batch — independent questions don't need separate round-trips.

**Few, important questions.** Three sharp probes force a real decision; ten low-stakes ones get answered with shrugs. The bar: "will the answer change a variant constraint?" If no, don't ask.

Sample probes (adapt):
- "Who is doing this and what decision are they making? My read: X. Confirm?"
- "What's the smallest UI surface that delivers the outcome? My read: just A, not B."
- "Primary state — populated / empty / loading / error — which is most common in real use?"
- "New primitive (variants explore shape) or extension (variants explore application)?"
- "What gets overflowed/truncated when dense? My read: …"
- "Which existing component does this compose from? My read: …"

Stop when the brief is clear. 3-7 branches typical.

## Phase 1 — Generate variants in parallel (count from Phase 0a)

For `routine`: produce **one** variant honoring the named existing component / pattern, plus an explicit `rejected.md` block listing the X / Y / Z directions you considered and rejected (one line each). Do NOT regenerate the rejected directions.

For `routine-low-conf`: produce **two** variants — A "stay close to existing pattern" and B "challenge the existing pattern".

For `novel` (and all new load-bearing primitives): produce **three radically different** variants. Anti-convergence is a hard rule: variants that all feel like minor tweaks of one idea = fail.

Each variant uses the work-package brief + design-system pointers + a different **constraint-and-thesis pairing** so the spread is intentional, not accidental:

```
Variant A — "Minimal scaffold"
  Constraint: smallest possible component count; reuse existing primitives without
              inventing anything new. The shape is whatever falls out of recombining
              what's already in the design system.
  Thesis: prove the feature can ship inside the component budget with zero new shapes.

Variant B — "Power-density rethink"
  Constraint: optimise for the single most common power-user task. Cut everything
              else from the primary view; push it to a detail/secondary surface.
  Thesis: density and speed beat completeness. Show what the user actually does
          80% of the time at maximum information density.

Variant C — "Reference-borrowed"
  Constraint: take inspiration from a SPECIFIC named reference (a product whose
              interaction grammar fits) — pick one and embody it cleanly without
              copying chrome. The orchestrator names the reference per work package.
  Thesis: a proven interaction grammar shortens the user's learning curve.
```

If the work package is for a *new design-system primitive*, substitute the constraints to explore the **shape itself**:

```
Variant A — "Container with payload" (the shape is a thin container; the payload
            does the work; minimal API surface).
Variant B — "Self-contained block" (the primitive owns its layout, states, and
            affordances; consumers parameterise but don't recompose).
Variant C — "Layered" (a base layer that always renders + extension slots that
            consumers fill — the slot/children composition pattern).
```

Anti-convergence requirement — verify before Phase 2:
- Variants must differ on **at least 3 of these axes per pair**: hierarchy (where the eye lands first), density (how much fits per row/screen), state strategy (one canonical layout vs distinct shapes per state), motion (where it moves), action surface (where verbs live), composition (one component vs three), copy register (terse vs guided).

If two variants converge, regenerate. Do not proceed with three flavours of one thing.

### Output per variant — the spec is concrete OR it doesn't count

Each variant produces, in `.pipeline/work/<id>/design/<variant-slug>/`:

1. **`spec.md`** — opinionated spec, no hand-waving:
   - User task (1 sentence — who, what, why)
   - Component composition: which existing components are used where (named, not "a card-like thing")
   - Information hierarchy: numbered 1/2/3, with one-line content per slot
   - All states: empty / loading / error / populated / overflow — described with copy and component names
   - Behavior: hover, focus, keyboard shortcuts, focus-trap rules, transitions (named: motion/fast/medium/slow)
   - Responsive adaptation: how it maps to narrow / mobile layouts
   - The **signature** — the one thing that makes this variant unmistakably itself
   - Trade-offs: what this variant is bad at
2. **`mockup.html`** (preferred) — a self-contained HTML file that **embodies** the variant. Imports the design system tokens (link to `{{designSystem.tokens}}`), uses real data shapes from the work package, demonstrates the primary state. The mockup IS the variant; describing motion in prose while the mockup uses default 200ms transitions = fail.
3. **`screenshot.png`** — a screenshot of `mockup.html` at desktop width, using whatever screenshot tooling the project has available.

If HTML mockups are too heavy for the work package (small primitive, well-understood shape), produce *spec + a component sketch in the design system's playground/sandbox* instead. The hard rule is: each variant must produce a **looked-at artifact**, not just prose.

## Phase 2 — Build the comparison

Produce `.pipeline/work/<id>/design/comparison.md`:

| Dimension | Variant A | Variant B | Variant C |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signature (one tell) | … | … | … |
| Component count | … | … | … |
| Density | … | … | … |
| Primary action surface | … | … | … |
| State strategy | … | … | … |
| Motion budget | … | … | … |
| Best at | … | … | … |
| Worst at | … | … | … |
| Phase-2 critique score | … /10 | … /10 | … /10 |

Plus the screenshots side by side.

## Phase 3 — Synthesize

Often the best design combines insights from multiple variants. Write `.pipeline/work/<id>/design/synthesis.md`:

- Which variant is the strongest base?
- Which elements from the others are worth pulling in?
- What gets explicitly **rejected** and why (this list matters as much as the chosen direction — it prevents re-litigation)?

If the project is in autonomous mode, the orchestrator picks based on:
1. Highest critique score
2. Lowest component-budget cost
3. Best fit with the project's stated design constraints (no cargo-culted patterns that the project has explicitly ruled out — honor any "anti-pattern" list the design system docs maintain).

If a maintainer is reachable, surface the comparison and **let them pick**. One question, with the variants + your recommendation. Never batch design decisions across multiple separate questions.

## Phase 4 — Approve and write the chosen design

Once a direction is chosen, write `.pipeline/work/<id>/design/approved.md`; update `plan.md` only if the design changes the overall plan (scope/ACs):

- The chosen variant + any pulled-in elements from siblings
- The rejected list (so `/architecture` and the build phase don't re-litigate)
- Component mapping: which design-system components are used, where, what props
- All states with copy
- Behavior + motion + keyboard shortcuts
- Responsive adaptation
- Open questions for the architect (data shape, route, action endpoints)

`approved.md` is the **input contract** to `/architecture`. The architect does NOT re-decide visual hierarchy, component vocabulary, or interaction grammar.

## Anti-patterns

- Three flavors of one thing. Variants must differ on shape, not accent.
- Specs without concrete values. Use named tokens, not "clean, modern".
- Mockups that describe instead of embody.
- Skipping the Phase 2 critique gate.
- Re-litigating the visual contract in `/architecture`.
- AI-aesthetic defaults — see the design system's anti-pattern documentation and `references/finishing.md`.

```

## Done when

- `approved.md` exists with the locked design + explicit rejection list.
- Every variant produced a looked-at artifact (mockup/screenshot or sandbox sketch), not just prose.
- The Phase 2 critique gate ran and scores are recorded in `comparison.md`.

## Downstream

- `/architecture` — consumes `approved.md` as fixed input; never re-litigates the visual contract; runs its own in-session architectural critique.
