# Write Docs — Reading-Funnel-Optimized Documentation

Write or revise user-facing documentation (product pages, guides, feature docs) so every page works as a **reading funnel** — capturing attention in seconds, delivering insights progressively, and converting scanners into active users.

This skill applies to writing AND reviewing documentation. It is backed by empirical research, not opinion.

## Project rules

This repo can steer this skill through `pipeline.config rules`. Before you act, read any of these declared slots that apply and treat them as **binding** — where a project rule conflicts with this skill's generic guidance, the project rule wins. A slot the repo left null is simply absent: skip it, never block on it.

- **`{{rules.docs}}`** — the project's documentation voice & conventions.

## When this runs

- A work package's acceptance criteria include user-facing docs or copy.
- A reviewer is scoring documentation deliverables before ship.
- An existing doc set is being audited and revised.

## The Reading Funnel

Documentation is a funnel. Every page loses readers at each stage. The writer's job is to minimize drop-off at each gate.

```
LAND (0-3s)       → "Am I in the right place?"    → 50% bounce if no match
SCAN (3-10s)      → "Does this have what I need?"  → 70% gone if no value signal
EVALUATE (10-30s) → "Is this worth my time?"       → 80% gone if no concrete proof
ENGAGE (30s-2m)   → "Can I use this right now?"    → Reader commits to a section
ACTIVATE (2m+)    → "What do I do next?"           → Reader converts to user
```

**The critical gate is 10 seconds.** Users leave or stay within the first 10 seconds (NNG, n=205,873 pages). Pages that survive initial scrutiny hold attention for 2+ minutes. Everything before 10 seconds is a retention problem; everything after is a comprehension problem.

**79% of users scan, not read** (NNG, consistent 1997-present). Design for scanners first, readers second.

**Users read at most 28% of words on a page; 20% is more likely** (NNG, n=45,237 page views). Every word must earn its place.

## The 15 Principles

These are specific, measurable rules. Not guidelines — rules. Each has an empirical basis (full citations in `references/research-basis.md`).

### Structure

**P1 — First insight in 10 seconds.** The opening 50-80 words must answer "what is this" and "why should I care." No preamble, no history, no "in this document we will." Lead with the answer.

**P2 — Inverted pyramid.** Conclusion first, then supporting detail, then background. The most important information is at the top of every page and every section. A reader who stops at any point has gotten the most valuable content available to them.

**P3 — One heading per 150-200 words.** Headings are the primary scan target (Layer-Cake pattern is "by far the most effective scanning pattern" — NNG). Each heading must standalone as an information-scent signal. A reader scanning only headings should understand the page structure.

**P4 — Maximum 4 concepts per section.** Working memory holds ~4 chunks (Cowan 2001, revising Miller). Each section introduces at most 4 new ideas, then grounds them with an example or summary before proceeding.

**P5 — Progressive disclosure in 3 layers max.** Summary (visible) → detail (one click/scroll) → reference (linked). Never nest deeper than 3 levels.

### Sentences and Paragraphs

**P6 — Sentences average 14-20 words.** At 14 words, comprehension is 90%. At 43 words, comprehension drops below 10%. No sentence exceeds 35 words.

**P7 — Paragraphs under 100 words (3-4 sentences).** Web paragraphs over 150 words are too long for screen reading. Short paragraphs create whitespace that signals approachability. 81% of users look at the 1st paragraph; only 32% look at the 4th (NNG).

**P8 — Front-load information-carrying words.** Users scan the first 2-3 words of headings, list items, and paragraph openings (F-pattern). Put the meaningful noun or verb first. "Create a team" not "How to go about creating a team." When introducing a load-bearing primitive of the project, lead with its property: "Sessions expire after 30 minutes" not "One of the key concepts in this project is the session."

### Visual Density

**P9 — Code or visual within first 2 screenfuls.** The first two screenfuls capture 74% of viewing time (NNG). A code example, diagram, or table must appear before this threshold. For product docs without code, use a concrete scenario, comparison table, or structural diagram.

**P10 — Every key concept gets a concrete aid.** Text + visual yields 65% retention at 3 days vs. 10% for text alone (Medina, dual-coding theory). The aid can be: code block, diagram, table, screenshot, or worked example. Never rely on prose alone for a concept the reader must remember.

**P11 — Bullet lists for 3+ parallel items.** Users gravitationally fixate on bulleted lists (NNG). Lists compress scanning time and signal structured information. Use numbered lists only for sequential steps.

### Language

**P12 — Zero promotional language.** Objective text improved usability 27% on its own; combined with concise + scannable, 124% improvement (NNG, n=51, A/B tested). Never describe features as "powerful," "seamless," "revolutionary," "intuitive," "easy," or "simple." State what it does. Show how it works.

**P13 — Concise above all.** Concise text improved usability by 58% — the single highest-impact writing change measured (NNG). Cut every word that doesn't carry information. If removing a sentence doesn't reduce understanding, remove it.

### Activation

**P14 — Time to first working result under 5 minutes.** For getting-started and quickstart pages, the reader must achieve a working result within 5 minutes. The classic exemplars are "7 lines of code," one-click deploy, instant provisioning. The path must be obvious and unbroken.

**P15 — Every page ends with a concrete next action.** After the content: "Next: [specific page]" or "Try it: [specific action]." Never end a documentation page in a dead end. The funnel continues.

## Scoring Rubric

Use the 10-dimension rubric (1-5 each, 50 max) in `references/rubric.md` when reviewing documentation. Score every dimension; do not average away a structural failure.

**Thresholds:**
- **40-50:** Publication-ready. Ship it.
- **30-39:** Minor revision needed. Specific dimensions below 3 need targeted fixes.
- **20-29:** Significant rewrite. Structural issues (pyramid, heading, disclosure).
- **Below 20:** Complete restructuring required.

## How to Use This Skill

### Codebase verification (MANDATORY for feature/UI documentation)

Before describing any feature, component, or interaction: search `{{paths.source}}` to confirm it exists, read the source file, and verify the behavior matches what you're about to write. Documentation without codebase evidence is hallucination. Zero tolerance for fabricated features — if you can't find it in the code, don't document it. If the doc describes commands, confirm they run (e.g. the project's verify command, `{{verify}}`).

### As a writer

1. Read the work package's acceptance criteria (`.pipeline/work-packages/<id>` and `progress/<id>.json` for state).
2. Before writing, plan the funnel: what's the 10-second value? What's the first concrete aid? What's the exit action?
3. Write the opening 50-80 words first. This is the most important text on the page.
4. Apply P1-P15 as you draft. Check sentence length as you go (count words in any sentence that feels long).
5. After drafting, self-score against the rubric. Any dimension below 3 needs revision before submission.

### As a reviewer

1. Score the document against all 10 rubric dimensions.
2. For any dimension scoring below 3: provide a specific finding with the principle number, location, and fix.
3. Total score must be ≥35 for approval (≥3.5 average per dimension).
4. The two most common failure modes:
   - **Buried lede** (P1/P2 violation): the opening paragraph is context/motivation instead of the answer.
   - **Wall of text** (P3/P7/P9 violation): long paragraphs, no headings, no visual aids.

### When applying to existing docs

Read each document. For each page:
1. Score it against the rubric (current state).
2. Identify the top 3 lowest-scoring dimensions.
3. Revise to address those dimensions specifically.
4. Re-score. All dimensions must be ≥3; total must be ≥35.

## Done when

- Every changed page scores ≥35 with no dimension below 3.
- Every documented feature is backed by source evidence in `{{paths.source}}`.
- Docs live under `{{paths.docs}}` and any commands they reference actually run.
- Each page ends with a concrete next action (P15) and opens its funnel in 10 seconds (P1).
